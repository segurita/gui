## What is security analysis
Security analysis is the analysis of tradeable financial instruments. For our
purposes we will restrict ourselves to the analysis of the financial health of
companies in order to buy or sell their shares in the stock market.

## How can I analyze companies?
You can apply the principles of "security analysis" as spelled out by Ben Graham
and some of his followers (Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for example).

## Security analysis on my own can be difficult
That's the goal of this project. We will do the analysis by following the recipe
in Ben Graham's book "The intelligent investor" of some companies that can be
traded in the Peruvian stock market.

We will show a simple table with the following information:

Company, Value per share, Price per share, Margin of safety

Note that value and price are not the same thing. For value, we understand that
amount that reflects how much the company is worth, taking into account assets,
liabilities and income.
For price, we understand that it is what the stock market says that this company
is worth.

We know that most of the time price and value are roughly the same. However,
sometimes the market over estimates ridiculously high prices (during bull markets)
and even ridiculously low prices (during bear markets).

We hope that by having a list of companies and the value next to the current price
we can take advantage of the miscalculations in value of the stock market. A time
of global economical crisis is a time of opportunities.

## Global economical crisis occur roughly every 8-10 years

## So, it is about time a new global crisis occur.
During a crisis some effects are
remarkable: the stock markets around the world crash and some good companies get
hit in the stock prices and become very cheap, almost as peanuts.

While people lose their shirts during this periods (bear markets), this is actually
the time to invest and pour money in stocks. As Warren Buffett once said: "This
is the time to become rich".

## But one might ask: can I buy any company?
How do I know that the share price is
cheap because of investors fear and not because this is a lousy company.
To answer these questions one might have to evaluate each company to estimate its
value and after a comparison with the price (number of shares multiplied by share price)
one might recognize good investment opportunities.
